Dataset 1: 
Title: Student Habits Vs. Academic Performance
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayaantanaath/student-habits-vs-academic-performance
Kaggle Author: Jayanta Nath

Research Questions:
1.	Does increased time spent watching Netflix negatively affect students’ academic performance as measured by GPA, at a significant level (p<0.05)?
2.	What numbers of hours study per week result in optimal performance before a plateau in students’ academic performance.
3.	What other dataset features negatively affect student academic outcomes? 
Learning Objectives: 
a)	Define and characterize data through exploratory data analysis using PowerBI power query and visualization dashboard. Visualize summary statistics. 
b)	Use DAX or M to help visualize and estimate hours study vs. academic performance.
c)	Use PowerBI visualization tools to convey which features negatively affect student performance. 

Dataset 2:
Title: Galton’s Height Data Multiple Linear Regression
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fundal/galtons-height-data-multiple-linear-regression
Kaggle Author: Madiha

Research Questions:
1.	Which parent is more deterministic of a child’s height outcome?
2.	What is the expected adult height of a female daughter based on father who 6’2 and a mother who is 5’10?
3.	How accurate is the multi-variate linear regression model at predicting a child’s height based on parental heights? What is the variance and standard deviation?
Learning Objectives:
d)	Define and characterize data through exploratory data analysis using PowerBI power query and visualization dashboard. Visualize summary statistics. 
e)	Conduct multivariate regression using a Pytorch neural network to predict the height of a child based on the features height of father and mother. Use PowerBI Script interface to display prediction.
f)	Visualize model performance including gradient magnitude and gradient descent.
